    '''
    This function computes the moving Spearman rank correlation coefficient in a 3-dimensional dataset.
    The correlation between two quantities ('ys' and 'colours') are computed at fixed 'xs', which MUST be in ascending order.
    The user must set the size of the window in xs ('window_sizes') in which to compute the correlation between ys and colours
    and the 'step' through which this window moves in xs (window_steps). This window can vary over the range of xs,
    in which case the user must specify 'transition points' at which the window sizes change.

    The names 'xs', 'ys' and 'colours' refer to the elements on a plot which would typically be made using this function.
    For examples, see all plots in Davies, J. J. et al. (2019), MNRAS.
    The default values correspond to the parameters used in this paper. (xs = M200 in EAGLE)

    Arguments:

    xs - the values which we want to keep fixed while computing the Spearman rank correlation coefficient. Must be in ascending order.
    ys, colours - the values we want to compute the correlation between
    window_sizes - the number of datapoints in the moving window. This can have multiple values if you want the size of the window to change
                    at certain points in xs. This can be an int or a list.
    window_steps - the number of datapoints to step through when the window moves. If a list, must have the same length as window_sizes.
    transition_points - the values of xs at which to change the size/step of the window. Must have length len(window_sizes) - 1.


    Returns:

    centres - the centres of the moving window as it moved through xs.
    moving_rank - the moving Spearman rank coefficients
    moving_pvalue - the moving p-values, indicating the significance of the correlation in the moving window.
